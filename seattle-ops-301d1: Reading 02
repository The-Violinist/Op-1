Computer networks can be comprised of anything from 2 computers directly connected all the way up to a WAN that covers an entire country.
Each type is catered to the general purpose and size of the network. Within networks there are common physical devices which connect devices -- 
routers, switches, cables -- as well as the methods of connection -- ip addresses, ports, etc.

Network architecture is described as network topology. There are 4 main types: Bus, Ring, Star, and Mesh. 
Within these, star is the most common today, not necessarily because of cost, but for the availability and functionality. 

Along with the connectivity comes a need for security, and this is a major consideration when designing a network. 
In addition to security another major consideration when designing a larger network is load balancing in order to 
avoid bottlenecks and to reduce possible single points of failure.
